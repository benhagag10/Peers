## What is Peeps?

Ever struggle to remember everyone you've met at conferences, collaborators from past projects, or researchers whose work intersects with yours? **Peeps** is a visual network tool that helps you map and track the people in your field.

Build your own knowledge graph of connections — who knows who, how they're related, what they work on — so you never lose track of valuable relationships.

For the full experience with real-time sync, you'll also need to run the backend server. See `server/` for setup instructions.
